# Employee-Tracker-using-SQL

## Description

In this week's assignment, we are tasked with creating an SQL database to tracks employees, their roles, and their respective department, as well as their managers.

The application works such that the user is presented with a series of options, from which they can choose what tehy would like to do first. Upon selection of the option, they are present with a prompt based on their selections.


## Installation and Usage

This project utilized MySQL and Express.js and is run in the terminal. Therefore there is no website to view. A video of the application in work is linked below.

The application allows the following actions:

-When the user selects "view all employees", they can observe a table with all the employees of the company.
-When the user selects "view all roles", they will be presented with a table of all the current roles in the company.
-When the user selects"view all departments", they will presented with a table of all theeroles available in the database/ company.
